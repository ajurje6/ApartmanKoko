      "comment": "Upon arrival, they greeted us, handed over the keys, and showed us everything. Very nice and comfortable house. Very quiet place! The fridge had cold beer and prosecco. The hosts are wonderful and very kind. The house has everything you need. The beds are comfortable. There is a jacuzzi in the yard, a barbecue (the barbecue is excellent, the food tastes amazing), and a foosball table. But the ascent is very steep. You won‚Äôt want to walk there. I recommend using a car. Make sure your wheels and handbrake are in good condition) It‚Äôs also better to go to the beach by car. The local beach is very crowded, so the beaches in Tuƒçepi or Brela are better.",

      "comment": "The place is located high above Makarska, with a beautiful view. The apartment is the cleanest we‚Äôve ever stayed in! (2 adults and 2 children aged 10 and 12). On the table in the living room, we were welcomed with a bowl of abundance, prosecco, juice, sweets, snacks, and fruit. The kitchen is fully equipped, and we had tea and 3 (THREE types!) coffees. The apartment had air conditioning, two TVs, Netflix (set to Hungarian for us!), a comfortable bed, a washing machine, and a great jacuzzi. Instead of the noise and crowds of the city center, it‚Äôs worth living here as you are on the main road in 4-5 minutes, and many excellent beaches are just ten minutes away. The hosts also provided us with a barbecue. I recommend it to everyone who wants to relax in a beautiful place!",
